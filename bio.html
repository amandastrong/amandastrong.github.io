	     			<h1>Amanda Who?:</h1>
					<p class="arrow_box"><b>Hi! My name is Amanda Strong, and I am currently a senior studying Communications and Public Relations at Eastern Washington University in lovely Spokane, Washington.</b></p>
				</div>
					<section class="bio">
						<p> Although I started out at the Colorado School of Mines, majoring in Electrical Engineering, I quickly realized that my true passions were in a different area; project management, specifically in regards to creative enterprises.  Despite having to transfer programs, and schools, I will be graduating with my undergraduate in three years. </p>
					
						<p> When I am not in class, I devote a large amount of my time to Partnering for Progress (P4P), a local non-profit.  On top of being P4P's volunteer, Volunteer Coordinator, I also sit on their communications committee and am currently in charge of all of their social media efforts. </p>
						
						<p>Another organization I have proudly been a part of is the Northwest Museum of Arts &amp; Culture, Spokane's local Smithsonian affiliate.  Over the past two years I have had the opportunity to both work and intern for the MAC, acting as a Teaching Assistant for their summer art camp, "Get Messy at the MAC," working as a head cashier at both ArtFest, and their annual Mother's Day tour, and volunteering at various events such as BeGin, SuperSaturdays, and FirstFridays. </p>
			
						<p>After being a part of these amazing organizations and getting the chance to see the innerworkings of such operations first hand, I have been inspired to pursue a career in the creative industries.  After graduating in the Spring of 2015, I plan on continuing on to Northwestern University's Leadership in Creative Enterprises Masters program with hopes of one day working in a museum such as the Seattle Art Museum or MoMA.</p>
